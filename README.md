# Xavi's Asset Tool

## Overview

Xavi's Asset Tool is a comprehensive 3D game framework designed specifically for Unity. Aimed at facilitating the development of first-person games, this tool provides a robust system for entity interactions within the game environment. Every object in the game is based on an "Entity" class, allowing for complex interactions and behaviors.

## Features

- **Entity-Based Interaction**: All game objects utilize a unified entity class, enabling consistent and complex interactions across different types of objects.
  
- **Inventory Management**: Entities can store objects in a detailed inventory system. This includes features for equipping items directly from the inventory or using a fast-equip option via the mouse wheel and drop.
  
- **Object Manipulation**: Entities can throw or drop items, allowing for dynamic gameplay and interaction with the environment.
  
- **Environment Interaction**:
  - **Destruction**: Interactive elements such as destructible objects can be broken into pieces, adding a layer of realism and tactical depth.
  - **Explosions**: Implement area effects that can impact other entities, simulating explosions and other area-of-effect scenarios.
  - **Structural Damage**: Features include the ability to break windows and walls, enhancing the environmental interaction and visual realism.
